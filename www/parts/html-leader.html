/** 
 *
 * html-leader.html - this is the first include in every file.  Here we do any 
 * critical page setup, session management etc.  
 *
 * General Notes:
 * 
 * We use HTML 5 semantic elemnts for page layout:
 * 
 *   http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp
 *
 * Further we use Bootstrap to responde to different screens/devices gracefully, 
 * as well as provide a standardized layout and look and feel.
 *
 *   http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/
 * 
 * For jQuery we are going with 1.10.  This is a little old now, but has the most
 * broad support for existing widgets/plugins.  If its really needed we'll jump 
 * to the latest version (2.x).
 *
 *   https://jquery.com/download/
 *
 * For time/date features we rely on Moment:
 *
 *   http://momentjs.com/
 *
 * All of our graphing is done by Highcharts, because...Highcharts! 
 *
 *   http://www.highcharts.com/
 *
 * We don't use Node.js, Bower etc.  This web site is just a flat set of HTML/PHP 
 * files. The structure should be fairly obvious:
 *
 * <main>
 *
 *   css     - style files (including from Bootstrap)
 *   fonts   - any required custom fonts
 *   images  - images
 *   js      - all javascript (including from Bootstrap)
 *   parts   - pieces of our template (things like this file you are reading)
 *   library - the code for the website
 *   rest    - the REST API endpoint
 *
 * Other folders are related materials but not generally essential to the website 
 * (the GUI).
